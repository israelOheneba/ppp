                <h4>Protective Measures for civilians</h4><hr>
                <p>Circles are high risk zones! <br>  Follow thses prectices to prevent yourself from being the victim to crimes in the KMA<br>
                    Take it into mind that everyone is a suspect (Dep. CID secretary, Adum). Market places (Adum, Assafo, Kejetia) are full of thiefs, snachers and frauds
                     so be causion with your belongings all the time. <br>
                     For busy areas (Kejetia, Adum, Asafo, Bantama, Roman Hill, Race course), it is advisable to be in the crowd especially on the roads. <br>
                     Those wwith kids must hold them by the hand very tight. <br>
                     It is more advisable to visit shops to buy some goods like electrical gadgets to prevent being defrauded. <br>
                    Be discipline and do not talk to you do not know. Trust no one. Silenctly report any unpleasant act to the cops around. <br>
                    Do not engage in fights especial inn the market and lorry stations. <br>
                    Do not leave kids for others you do not know. <br><br>
                    Stay safe!
