                <hr>
                <p>Kumasi Metropolis in the Ashanti region is one of the areas with high population growth rate in Ghana over the years. Due to the number of 
                    commercial activities, demography of the area, crime driven factors such as high cost of living, urbanization, unemployment, etc. 
                    are also at their peak and hence crime of various kinds is also
                    in rapid growth of 2% per year (2017-2021).  <br><br>
                    The aim of this study is to map out crime in the Metropolis, this includes the type
                    of crimes happening in particular localities and making the crime map accessible to the civilians and law
                    enforcement agencies by putting it on a website.
                    This will help both civilians and police interact with the map and study the general patterns of crime to enable them work hand in hand.
                    A map showing the crime distribution in the metropolis will be produced using a ArcGIS. <br><br>
                    A handheld GPS was used in picking the locations of the crime spots while the
                    statistical parts including the number of crimes, the type of crimes and the years they were accumulated from was
                    obtained from the police departments and processed using microsoft excel.
                    ArcGIS was used to combine all these forms of data we obtained into one layer for spatial analytics. <br><br> Through
                    careful and technical processes
                    a visual representation of the hotspots and coldspots within the metropolis. These spots were spread accross
                    using color gradients with the red showing the hotspots and the blue showing the coldspots was produced.
                    A map showing the locations of the various police departments was also produced. <br><br>
                    These results will help the law enforcement agencies effectively control crime in the sense that they can
                    distribute more of their limited resources to where crime is actually happening (hotspots).</p>
